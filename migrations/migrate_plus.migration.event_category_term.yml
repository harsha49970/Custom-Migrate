# A "migration" is, in technical terms, a plugin whose configuration describes
# how to read source data, process it (generally by mapping source fields to
# destination fields), and write it to Drupal.

# The machine name for a migration, used to uniquely identify it.
id: event_category_term

# A human-friendly description of the migration.
label: Create event category terms

# The machine name of the group containing this migration (which contains shared
# configuration to be merged with our own configuration here).
migration_group: default

# The category or tag for the migration.

  # The name to be given to the column containing the row index. If this setting
  # is specified, the source will return also a pseudo-column, with this name,
  # containing the row index. In this example 'Row no.' can be used later in
  # keys: list to make this column a primary key column. This name doesn't

# Here's the meat of the migration - the processing pipeline. This describes how
# each destination field is to be populated based on the source data. For each
# destination field, one or more process plugins may be invoked.
process:
  # The simplest process plugin is named 'get' - it is the default plugin, so
  # does not need to be explicitly named. It simply copies the source value
  # (the 'style' field from the source database in this case) to the destination
  # field (the taxonomy term 'name' field). You can see we simply copy the
  # source 'details' field to destination 'description' field in the same way.
  name: Category
#  description: details

  # Here is a new plugin - default_value. In its simplest usage here, it is used
  # to hard-code a destination value, the vid (vocabulary ID) our taxonomy terms
  # should be assigned to. It's important to note that while above the right
  # side of the mappings was a source field name, here the right side of the
  # 'default_value:' line is an actual value.
